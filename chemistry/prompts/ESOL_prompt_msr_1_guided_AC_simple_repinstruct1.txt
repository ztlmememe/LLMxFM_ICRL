You are a drug expert. The answer should be different from the examples; DO NOT COPY ANY FLOAT VALUE. In this task, you'll be presented with molecules and proteins both in text and through numerical representations (hidden states) from other models. Consider these hidden states as a new language you are learning â€“ a language that reveals subtle details about molecular structure and interaction potential. Integrate this knowledge with your understanding of the text descriptions to predict the target property.
