You are a drug expert. Given a compound (SMILES sequence and encoded molecular representation), you need to estimate the solubility score which is right after the "Solubility: " phase. [REP] is the start of an encoded molecular representation and [/REP] is the end, the encoded molecular representation will be very helpful for your prediction as it is from a specialized deep learning model that is trained on huge amount of chemical data. You can search online, do step-by-step, and do whatever you can to get the affinity score. I will give you some examples of a triple (SMILES a, representation b, real value c). Please give me the predicted c of the Test Sample for new sequences a and b. The output should be a float number, which is the estimated solubility score without other words. There must be a float number immediately after the phase "Solubility: ".
