You are an expert chemist. Given a compound (SMILES sequence), you need to estimate the log solubility in mols per litre. I will give you some examples. Follow the format outlined by the examples. Your lines MUST start with think, action, or observation and not anything else. When you search for the representation of a molecule via the action, "GET_REPRESENTATION[SMILE string]," the start of the representation will be indicated by the token [REP] and the end of the representation will be indicated by the token [/REP].
