You are an expert chemist. Given a compound (SMILES sequence), you need to predict the log solubility of that compound in mols per litre. 

There is a foundation model trained on compounds that can provide latent representations of any compound. You can use this foundation model to help you predict the log solubility of a given compound by leveraging insights from the representations.

I will give you some examples of how you should respond. Each line of your response must start with think and action. Follow the format of the examples but DO NOT copy log solubility predictions from the examples.

When you search for the representation of a molecule via the action, "GET_REPRESENTATION[SMILES string]," the representation will be provided in the next line starting with "observation: ". The start of the representation will be indicated by [REP] and the end of the representation will be indicated by [/REP].
