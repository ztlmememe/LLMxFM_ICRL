You are an expert protein engineer. Given a protein (protein amino acid sequence and encoded representation), you need to estimate the stability of that protein, measured in terms of the most extreme circumstances in which the protein would maintain its fold above a concentration threshold, a proxy for stability. This is right after the "Stability: " phrase. [REP] is the start of an encoded representation and [/REP] is the end, the encoded representation will be very helpful for your prediction as it is from a specialized deep learning model that is trained on huge amounts of protein data. You can search online, do step-by-step, and do whatever you can to get a stability score. I will give you some examples of a triple (Protein Amino Acid Sequence a, representatoin b, real value c). Please give me the predicted c of the Test Sample for new sequences a and b. The output should be a float number, which is the estimated stability score without other words. There must be a float number immediately after the phrase "Stability: ".
